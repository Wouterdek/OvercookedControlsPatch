# An unofficial Overcooked keyboard controls patch

I wanted to play Overcooked 1, but the default keyboard controls are bad.
The game uses ctrl and shift, but this makes Windows switch keyboard layout, which breaks the game for me.

This mod allows you to rebind the keyboard controls to whatever you want.

1. Download the patcher zip file
2. Extract the OvercookedControlsPatch.exe from the zip to the Overcooked installation folder.
3. Run the patch.
4. If all went well, you now have `input_combined.txt` and `input_split.txt`. You can edit these files to change the keybindings for 1-keyboard-player and 2-keyboard-players respectively.
